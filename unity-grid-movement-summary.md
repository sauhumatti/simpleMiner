# Unity Grid-Based Movement System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of a grid-based movement system in Unity, including cave generation, character movement, and camera following.

## 1. Cave Grid System

### CaveGridSystem Script
This script handles the generation and management of the cave grid.

Key components:
- Grid dimensions (width and height)
- Cell size
- Tile prefab
- Ore types with probabilities and depth thresholds
- Methods for initializing the grid and generating the cave

```csharp
public class CaveGridSystem : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int gridWidth = 100;
    public int gridHeight = 100;
    public float cellSize = 1f;
    public GameObject tilePrefab;
    public Material emptyMaterial;
    public Material wallMaterial;

    private Tile[,] grid;
    private Vector2Int startPoint;

    [System.Serializable]
    public struct OreType
    {
        public string name;
        public float probability;
        public int depthThreshold;
        public Material material;
    }

    public OreType[] oreTypes;

    // Methods for grid initialization and cave generation
    // ...
}
```

## 2. Character Movement

### SmoothGridCharacterController Script
This script manages the character's movement on the grid.

Key features:
- Grid-based movement with smooth transitions
- Input handling for arrow key movement
- Coroutine for smooth movement between grid positions

```csharp
public class SmoothGridCharacterController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float moveSpeed = 5f;
    public CaveGridSystem gridSystem;

    private Vector2Int currentGridPosition;
    private Vector3 targetPosition;
    private bool isMoving = false;

    // Methods for handling input and movement
    // ...

    IEnumerator MoveCharacter(Vector2Int newPosition)
    {
        isMoving = true;
        Vector3 startPosition = transform.position;
        targetPosition = gridSystem.GridToWorldPosition(newPosition.x, newPosition.y);
        float journeyLength = Vector3.Distance(startPosition, targetPosition);
        float startTime = Time.time;

        while (Time.time - startTime < journeyLength / moveSpeed)
        {
            float distanceCovered = (Time.time - startTime) * moveSpeed;
            float fractionOfJourney = distanceCovered / journeyLength;
            transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(startPosition, targetPosition, fractionOfJourney);
            yield return null;
        }

        transform.position = targetPosition;
        currentGridPosition = newPosition;
        isMoving = false;

        Debug.Log($"Moved to grid position: {currentGridPosition}, world position: {transform.position}");
    }
}
```

## 3. Camera Follow

### CameraFollow Script
This script makes the camera follow the character smoothly.

```csharp
public class CameraFollow : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform target;
    public float smoothSpeed = 0.125f;
    public Vector3 offset;

    void LateUpdate()
    {
        if (target == null)
            return;

        Vector3 desiredPosition = target.position + offset;
        Vector3 smoothedPosition = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, desiredPosition, smoothSpeed);
        
        // Ensure the camera only moves in the X and Z axes if you're using a top-down view
        smoothedPosition.y = transform.position.y;
        
        transform.position = smoothedPosition;
    }
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the necessary scripts (CaveGridSystem, SmoothGridCharacterController, CameraFollow).
2. Set up the CaveGridSystem in the scene:
   - Create an empty GameObject and attach the CaveGridSystem script.
   - Configure grid dimensions, cell size, and ore types in the Inspector.
3. Create a character object and attach the SmoothGridCharacterController script.
4. Attach the CameraFollow script to the Main Camera and assign the character as the target.
5. Adjust camera settings for a top-down view (e.g., orthographic camera).
6. Fine-tune movement speed, camera smoothing, and other parameters as needed.

## Troubleshooting

If issues with movement persist:
1. Ensure grid-to-world position conversion is accurate in the CaveGridSystem.
2. Check for any collider issues that might interfere with movement.
3. Verify that the character's transform isn't being affected by external factors.
4. Use debug logs to track the character's position during movement.

## Next Steps

- Implement more complex cave generation algorithms.
- Add mining mechanics for interacting with ore tiles.
- Implement a depth-based color gradient for tiles.
- Add fog of war or tile reveal mechanics as the player explores.

Remember to iterate and test frequently to ensure smooth gameplay and resolve any issues that arise during development.
